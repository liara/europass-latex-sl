## LaTeX Europass template - slovenski prevod

This is a translation of
[Europecv](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/europecv) into
slovenian language. It uses the
[europecv](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/europecv/) 
class created for the [standard
CV](https://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/documents/curriculum-vitae/templates-instructions)
recomended by the Eurepean Commission. The class is contained in TeX Live and
MIKTeX as europecv and has localizations for almost all official languages of 
the EU.

Compile it with pdflatex, xelatex...

For a nicer template, have a look at [Plasmati Graduate
CV](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/plasmati-graduate-cv).
